Difficulties:

Overall I enjoy this challenge, I don't do this usually but I think it is a good practice for myself.
My biggest challenge was the time, I spent a lot of time with the switch to dark mode feature, but I am happy that it work at last. Also with testing I struggle a little. For managing state even that we use Bloc, also I like using Riverpod and Providers.
